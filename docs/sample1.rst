sample code1

In this sample, we demonstrate the read translation from Drop-seq to 10X Chromium V3. 12 bp random cell barcodes in Drop-seq reads are converted into 16 bp cell barcodes with a whitelist for 10X Chromium V3. Also, 8 bp UMIs in Drop-seq reads are converted into 12 bp UMIs for 10X Chromium V3 with parental variables of cell barcodes.
