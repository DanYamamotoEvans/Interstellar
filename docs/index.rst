Interstellar
========================================

Interstellar is a versatile software tool for sequencing read interpretation and emulation of barcoded sequencing data. 
Interstellar consists of four data processing methods, value extraction, value translation, demultiplex, and tag. Configurations 
for these processes should be described in a configure file by users.
All processes can also be applied to a parallel computing environment such as Univa Grid Engine for scalable data handling.
